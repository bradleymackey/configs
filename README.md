# Configs

Configuration files for my preferred setup.

## Install

Clone the repo, symlink folders/files in the relevant places.
This will ensure they stay in sync with this repo.

I'm just a fan of things working, and working fast.
There are probably better alternatives to some of these tools below, but they work really well for me in my workflow.
